# CHAP-Core: Project Goals, Domain, and Vision

## 1. Introduction: The "Why" Behind CHAP-Core

The Climate Health Analysis Platform Core (CHAP-Core) is a scientific software project designed to bridge the gap between climate science and public health. Its fundamental purpose is to provide a robust, extensible, and accessible platform for researchers, public health officials, and policymakers to investigate and understand the complex relationships between climate, environment, and health outcomes.

This document outlines the overarching mission, specific goals, target audience, key domain concepts, and the envisioned impact of the CHAP-Core project.

## 2. Mission and Vision

**Mission**: To empower the global health community with advanced tools and data-driven insights to quantify, predict, and mitigate the health impacts of climate variability and climate change.

**Vision**: A world where climate information is effectively integrated into public health decision-making, leading to more resilient health systems and improved population health outcomes in the face of a changing climate.

## 3. Core Problem Statement & Challenges Addressed

CHAP-Core aims to address several key challenges:

- **Complexity of Climate-Health Links**: The relationships between climate factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, humidity, extreme events) and health outcomes (e.g., vector-borne diseases, heat stress, respiratory illnesses, malnutrition) are often non-linear, involve time lags, and are influenced by various socio-economic and environmental confounders.
- **Data Integration**: Integrating diverse datasets – climate observations and projections, epidemiological records, population data, environmental data (e.g., land use, air quality), and socio-economic indicators – is a significant technical hurdle. These datasets often come in different formats, resolutions, and scales.
- **Analytical Capacity**: Many regions, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change, may lack the specialized tools or expertise to conduct sophisticated climate-health analyses.
- **From Research to Action**: Translating research findings into actionable information for public health interventions and policy development requires accessible and interpretable outputs.
- **Need for Early Warning Systems**: Proactive public health responses require predictive models that can provide early warnings of potential climate-sensitive health risks.

CHAP-Core seeks to provide a platform that lowers these barriers by offering standardized data processing capabilities, a range of modeling techniques, and tools for evaluation and visualization.

## 4. Target Users

CHAP-Core is designed to serve a diverse group of users:

- **Public Health Researchers & Epidemiologists**: To investigate climate-disease relationships, develop predictive models, and publish scientific findings.
- **Public Health Practitioners & Officials (e.g., Ministries of Health)**: To utilize climate-based early warning systems, inform preparedness and response strategies, and allocate resources effectively.
- **Climate Scientists & Service Providers**: To collaborate with the health sector by providing relevant climate data and model outputs in usable formats.
- **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) & International Agencies**: Working on climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and public health initiatives.
- **Policymakers**: To access evidence-based information for developing climate adaptation and public health policies.
- **Students and Educators**: As a tool for learning and teaching about climate and health interactions.

## 5. Key Domain Concepts for CHAP-Core

Understanding the following domain concepts is crucial for working with and contributing to CHAP-Core:

### a. Climate Science

- **Climate Variables**: Temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind, solar radiation, etc. Understanding their measurement, units, and typical spatio-temporal patterns. (Refer to `CLIMATE_GENERAL.MD` and `ERA5.MD`).
- **Climate Data Sources**:
  - **Reanalysis Products (e.g., ERA5)**: Gridded historical climate data combining models and observations.
  - **Satellite Remote Sensing (e.g., GEE datasets)**: Earth observation data for various environmental parameters.
  - **Climate Model Projections (e.g., CMIP outputs)**: Simulations of future climate under different emission scenarios. (Refer to `CLIMATE.MD`).
- **Climate Variability vs. Climate Change**: Distinguishing short-term fluctuations (e.g., ENSO) from long-term trends.
- **Extreme Climate Events**: Heatwaves, droughts, floods, intense storms, and their characterization.

### b. Epidemiology & Public Health

- **Health Outcomes**: Focus on climate-sensitive diseases and conditions:
  - **Vector-borne diseases**: Malaria, dengue, Zika, Lyme disease (distribution and activity of vectors like mosquitoes and ticks are often climate-sensitive).
  - **Water-borne diseases**: Cholera, typhoid (linked to precipitation, flooding, water quality).
  - **Heat-related illnesses**: Heat stress, heatstroke.
  - **Respiratory diseases**: Exacerbation of asthma, COPD (linked to air pollution, temperature, pollen).
  - **Malnutrition**: Climate impacts on agriculture and food security.
  - **Mental health impacts**.
- **Epidemiological Data**: Disease incidence/prevalence, mortality, morbidity records. Often aggregated by administrative units and time periods (e.g., weekly, monthly).
- **Confounding Factors**: Socio-economic status, access to healthcare, sanitation, population density, land use, interventions (e.g., vaccination campaigns, vector control) can modify or confound climate-health relationships.
- **Lag Effects**: The impact of a climate exposure on health may not be immediate but may occur after a certain time lag (e.g., mosquito breeding cycles).
- **Early Warning Systems (EWS)**: Systems that use climate (and other) information to predict periods of increased risk for specific health outcomes, allowing for timely public health interventions.

### c. Statistical Modeling & Time Series Analysis

- **Correlation vs. Causation**: A core principle in observational studies.
- **Time Series Models**: Techniques to analyze data points indexed in time order (e.g., ARIMA, regression with lagged variables, generalized additive models - GAMs).
- **Spatio-temporal Models**: Models that account for both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Machine Learning Approaches**: Random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, etc., for predictive modeling. (Refer to `chap_core.models` and adaptors like `gluonts.py`).
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics for assessing predictive performance (e.g., RMSE, MAE, skill scores), backtesting, cross-validation. (Refer to `chap_core.assessment`).

### d. Geospatial Analysis

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Concepts**: Working with vector data (polygons for administrative units) and raster data (gridded climate data).
- **Zonal Statistics**: Aggregating raster data (e.g., mean temperature) over polygon areas.
- **Spatial Interpolation**: Estimating values at unobserved locations.
- (Refer to `GOOGLE_EARTH_ENGINE.MD` for a key platform used).

## 6. High-Level Benefits & Envisioned Impact of CHAP-Core

- **Improved Understanding**: Facilitating research into how climate affects health in diverse settings.
- **Enhanced Predictive Capability**: Enabling the development and deployment of climate-based health early warning systems.
- **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Providing tools and outputs that can inform public health policies and climate adaptation strategies.
- **Capacity Building**: Making advanced analytical tools more accessible to researchers and practitioners globally.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Fostering collaboration between climate scientists, health professionals, and data scientists.
- **Contribution to Global Health Security**: By helping communities prepare for and respond to climate-related health threats.

By focusing on these goals and leveraging knowledge from these interconnected domains, CHAP-Core aims to be a significant contributor to addressing the health challenges of a changing climate.
