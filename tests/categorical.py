# Improvement Suggestions:
# 1. **Clarify Status**: Add a prominent comment at the top of the file (or update this one) explicitly stating that all code within this file is currently commented out and non-operational.
# 2. **Evaluate Necessity & Cleanup**: Assess if this commented-out code is still needed for any purpose (e.g., reference, future feature). If it's obsolete, it should be removed from the repository to avoid confusion and reduce codebase size.
# 3. **Document Original Intent (If Kept for Reference)**: If the code is kept as commented-out reference, add a more detailed block comment explaining its original purpose (e.g., "Experimental JAX-based categorical parameter transformation for SEIR models"), why it was commented out, and its current status or any known issues.
# 4. **Resolve Import Issues (If Restored)**: If this code were to be uncommented, the import `from chap_core.time_period import dataclasses` is unusual and likely incorrect; standard `dataclasses` should be imported directly. Other imports like `PydanticTree` and `jnp` would also need to be valid.
# 5. **Review and Refactor Logic (If Restored)**: If restored, the function `f` has an unreachable return statement. The transformations (log, exp, normalization) should be clearly documented, especially their mathematical implications and use cases (e.g., ensuring parameters sum to one after transformation).

# NOTE: All code in this file is currently commented out.
# The commented-out code below appears to define a transformation
# for categorical parameters, possibly for use with JAX-based models,
# involving log and exponential transformations and normalization.

# from chap_core.external.models.jax_models.deterministic_seir_model import PydanticTree
# from chap_core.time_period import dataclasses # Suspicious import, likely should be `import dataclasses`
# from .jax import jnp # Assuming a local 'jax.py' utility or direct jax import
