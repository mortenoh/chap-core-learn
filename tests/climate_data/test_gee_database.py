# Improvement Suggestions:
# 1. **Clarify Test Status & Skipped Reasons**: All tests are currently skipped. Investigate the reasons (e.g., "ee not supported" implies issues with Google Earth Engine access/setup, or the tested features might be deprecated). Update skip messages for clarity or unskip tests if the underlying issues are resolved or features are current.
# 2. **Update or Remove Obsolete Code**: The import for `ERA5DataBase` from `gee_legacy` is commented out, suggesting it might be deprecated. If so, `test_era5` and `test_era5_daily` are likely obsolete and should be removed or updated to use current GEE interfaces (potentially related to the `google_earth_engine` fixture).
# 3. **Complete `test_get_climate_data_for_dataset`**: This test is skipped and its body only references the `google_earth_engine` fixture. If it's a placeholder for a valid test, it should be implemented with specific GEE operations and assertions. Otherwise, it should be removed.
# 4. **Manage Test Output Files**: `test_era5` and `test_era5_daily` write CSV files (`climate_data.csv`, `climate_data_daily.csv`) to the current working directory. Tests should avoid writing to fixed paths and instead use pytest's `tmp_path` fixture for temporary output that is automatically managed.
# 5. **Strengthen Assertions (If Revived)**: If these tests are made active, the assertions should go beyond just checking the length of the returned data. They should ideally verify specific data points, data types, or statistical properties of the fetched climate data to ensure correctness.

"""
Tests related to fetching and processing climate data, likely from Google Earth Engine (GEE).

NOTE: All tests in this file are currently marked as skipped. They appear to target
an `ERA5DataBase` from a `gee_legacy` module (which is commented out) and a
`google_earth_engine` fixture. These tests may be obsolete or require updates
to reflect the current GEE integration in CHAP-core.
