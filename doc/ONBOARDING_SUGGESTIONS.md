# Suggestions for Enhancing New Developer Onboarding

The CHAP-Core project already has a strong set of documentation, including:

- `README.md` (initial pointer)
- `STARTUP.MD` (excellent setup and project guide)
- `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md` (detailed system architecture)
- `DOCKER.MD` (comprehensive Docker usage)
- `LEARN.MD` (in-depth module summaries)
- `EXTERNAL.MD` (external services and dependencies)
- `GITHUB.MD` (CI/CD overview)
- `UV_WORKSPACES.MD` (plan for `uv` workspaces)
- `EXTERNAL_DATA.MD` (overview of example data)
- Sphinx documentation in `docs_source/` (likely including API docs and contributor guides)

To further enhance the onboarding experience for new team members, especially those unfamiliar with the climate and health domain or the specific goals of CHAP, the following additional documentation or sections are suggested:

## 1. Create `PROJECT_GOALS_AND_DOMAIN.md`

**Purpose**: To provide a high-level understanding of the "why" and "what" of the CHAP project, beyond the technical implementation details.

**Suggested Content**:

- **Mission and Vision**: What is CHAP aiming to achieve? What impact is it intended to have?
- **Core Problem Statement**: What specific challenges in climate and health analysis does CHAP address?
- **Target Users**: Who is CHAP for (e.g., researchers, public health officials, policymakers)?
- **Key Domain Concepts**:
  - Brief introduction to relevant epidemiological concepts.
  - Overview of climate data types used (e.g., ERA5, GEE) and their significance.
  - Fundamentals of time series analysis and forecasting in this context.
  - Explanation of any specific methodologies or analytical approaches central to CHAP.
- **High-Level Benefits**: What are the advantages of using CHAP?

**Placement**: In the project root, and linked from `STARTUP.MD`.

## 2. Enhance Contribution Guidelines (e.g., in `docs_source/contributor/CONTRIBUTING.md`)

**Purpose**: To provide clear, detailed instructions and expectations for contributing to the project. While `STARTUP.MD` touches on this, a dedicated, comprehensive guide is standard.

**Check/Add Content**:

- **Code of Conduct**: Link to or include a Code of Conduct.
- **Getting Help**: Preferred channels for asking questions (Slack, GitHub Discussions, specific maintainers).
- **Reporting Bugs**: How to submit effective bug reports (template, information to include).
- **Suggesting Enhancements/Features**: Process for proposing new ideas.
- **Development Workflow**:
  - Branching strategy (e.g., `git-flow` - feature branches, develop, main/master).
  - Commit message conventions.
  - Pull Request (PR) process:
    - PR template.
    - Expectations for PR descriptions.
    - How to request reviews.
    - Code review process and expectations (for reviewers and authors).
    - Policy on WIP (Work In Progress) PRs.
  - Testing requirements (unit tests, integration tests, coverage expectations).
- **Code Style and Conventions**:
  - Beyond Ruff: Naming conventions, preferred design patterns, comments, docstring style (e.g., Google, NumPy).
  - Specific advice for Python, SQLModel, FastAPI, etc.
- **Documentation**: Expectations for updating documentation when making code changes.
- **Licensing**: Brief mention of the project's license.

**Placement**: Ideally, a comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.MD` in `docs_source/contributor/` and linked prominently from `README.md` and `STARTUP.MD`.

## 3. Add to `STARTUP.MD`: "Curated Learning Path" & "Finding Your First Task"

**Purpose**: To guide new developers on how to approach learning the codebase and getting involved.

### Suggested Section: "Curated Learning Path for New Developers"

- Briefly explain that `LEARN.MD` is exhaustive.
- Suggest a sequence of key modules or concepts to understand first, tailored to different roles if applicable (e.g., backend developer, data scientist).
  - Example: "1. Understand core data types (`chap_core/datatypes.py`, `chap_core/spatio_temporal_data/`). 2. Review the main API structure (`chap_core/rest_api_src/`). 3. Explore the modeling engine (`chap_core/models/`, `chap_core/predictor/`)."
- Point to `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.MD` as a map for this journey.

### Suggested Section: "Finding Your First Task"

- Link to the GitHub project board mentioned in `README.md`.
- Explain how to find issues, especially those tagged "good first issue", "help wanted", or similar.
- Advise on how to claim an issue or discuss it before starting work.
- Encourage starting with smaller, well-defined tasks to get familiar with the contribution process.

## 4. Develop End-to-End Workflow Examples/Tutorials

**Purpose**: To show how different parts of CHAP work together to solve a real (or realistic) problem.

**Format**: These could be Jupyter notebooks, Markdown documents with code snippets, or part of the Sphinx documentation.

**Suggested Content**:

- A few walkthroughs, e.g.:
  - "Tutorial: Analyzing Disease X with Climate Variable Y using CHAP."
  - "From Raw Data to Prediction: An End-to-End Example."
- Each tutorial should cover:
  - Data preparation/ingestion.
  - Model configuration and training.
  - Prediction generation.
  - Evaluation and interpretation of results.
  - Using the CLI and/or API for these steps.

**Placement**: In `docs_source/tutorials/` or `examples/` directory, linked from the main Sphinx documentation and `STARTUP.MD`.

By implementing these suggestions, new contributors should find it easier to understand the project's purpose, navigate the codebase, and start contributing effectively.
