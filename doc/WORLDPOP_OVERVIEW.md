# WorldPop: Global High-Resolution Population Data

## 1. Introduction to WorldPop

**WorldPop** is a research program and initiative based at the University of Southampton, UK (with contributions from other institutions). It produces open and high-resolution gridded geospatial data on human population distribution, demographics, and dynamics across the globe, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries.

The primary goal of WorldPop is to provide an evidence base for decision-making in areas such as health, development, disaster response, and resource allocation by offering detailed and contemporary maps of where people live and their characteristics.

## 2. Key Characteristics and Goals

- **Mission**: To produce and disseminate high-quality, spatially explicit, and temporally consistent population data for research, policy, and practice.
- **Focus**: Global coverage, with particular emphasis on providing detailed data for low- and middle-income countries where official census data may be infrequent, outdated, or at coarse administrative unit levels.
- **Open Data**: WorldPop datasets are typically made freely available to the public under open licenses (e.g., Creative Commons).
- **High Resolution**: Aims to provide data at a fine spatial resolution, often around 100 meters per pixel (3 arc-seconds) or 1 km per pixel.
- **Methodology**: Employs advanced geospatial and statistical modeling techniques, integrating various data sources including:
  - Official census data (national and sub-national).
  - Household surveys (e.g., DHS, MICS, LSMS).
  - Satellite imagery (e.g., for mapping settlements, land cover).
  - GIS data (e.g., roads, waterways, protected areas, elevation).
  - Mobile phone data (anonymized call detail records - CDRs) for mobility mapping.
  - Other ancillary data.
- **Transparency**: Strives for transparency in its methods, often publishing detailed methodology papers.

## 3. Key Data Products

WorldPop produces a wide range of gridded population and demographic datasets:

### a. Population Counts and Density

- **Description**: Estimates of the number of people per grid cell (pixel) or population density.
- **Resolution**: Typically ~100m or ~1km.
- **Temporal Coverage**: Annual estimates for recent years (e.g., 2000-2020) and sometimes projections.
- **Types**:
  - **Constrained**: Population estimates are constrained to settled areas identified from satellite imagery, meaning uninhabited areas (e.g., deserts, dense forests, water bodies) are masked out. This often provides more realistic distributions than unconstrained estimates.
  - **Unconstrained**: Population estimates are distributed across all land areas.

### b. Age and Sex Structures

- **Description**: Estimates of the number of people or proportion of the population by specific age groups (e.g., under 5, 15-49, over 60) and sex, per grid cell.
- **Resolution**: Typically ~100m or ~1km.
- **Importance**: Crucial for understanding demographic vulnerability, planning health services (e.g., maternal and child health, elderly care), and targeting interventions.

### c. Births and Pregnancies

- **Description**: Gridded estimates of the number of births and pregnancies per grid cell.
- **Resolution**: Typically ~100m or ~1km.
- **Importance**: Essential for maternal and child health planning, resource allocation for obstetric care, and vaccination campaigns.

### d. Poverty and Wealth

- **Description**: High-resolution maps of poverty indicators or wealth quintiles.
- **Methodology**: Often combines survey data on household wealth/poverty with geospatial covariates using machine learning.
- **Importance**: Helps identify vulnerable populations and target poverty alleviation programs.

### e. Migration and Mobility

- **Description**: Estimates of internal and international migration flows, and measures of human mobility patterns (e.g., derived from anonymized mobile phone data).
- **Importance**: Understanding population movement is critical for disease spread modeling, disaster response, and urban planning.

### f. Other Demographic and Geographic Datasets

- Population growth rates.
- Urbanization patterns.
- Accessibility to services (e.g., travel time to healthcare facilities).
- Datasets specific to certain vulnerable groups (e.g., women of childbearing age).

## 4. Methodology Overview

WorldPop uses a "bottom-up" dasymetric modeling approach for many of its core population datasets:

1.  **Census Data Disaggregation**: Starts with the best available official census data, usually at administrative unit levels.
2.  **Covariate Data Collection**: Gathers a wide range of high-resolution geospatial covariate datasets that are known to correlate with population presence and density (e.g., settlement layers from satellite imagery, land cover, elevation, slope, roads, night-time lights, waterways, protected areas).
3.  **Statistical Modeling**: Uses machine learning techniques (often Random Forest models) to establish a statistical relationship between the census population counts and the covariate data within census units. This model essentially learns how population density varies with different environmental and infrastructure characteristics.
4.  **Prediction**: Applies the trained model to predict population density at a fine grid cell resolution (e.g., 100m) across the entire region or country.
5.  **Constraining and Adjustment**: The high-resolution predictions are then adjusted (constrained) so that the sum of population in grid cells within each census unit matches the original official census totals for that unit. This ensures consistency with official figures while providing a more detailed sub-unit distribution.

For other products like age/sex structures or births, similar principles apply, often involving disaggregation of survey data or vital statistics using relevant covariates.

## 5. Data Access

WorldPop data is primarily accessible through:

- **WorldPop Website ([https://www.worldpop.org/](https://www.worldpop.org/))**:
  - **Data Portal**: The main hub for browsing and downloading datasets. Users can typically select country, dataset type, year, and resolution.
  - **Methods Documentation**: Detailed information on how each dataset was produced.
- **Direct Download**: Datasets are usually provided as GeoTIFF (`.tif`) files, which are georeferenced raster images.
- **WorldPop Open Population Repository (WOPR)**: A platform for sharing and accessing population datasets.
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**: Many WorldPop datasets are available in the GEE data catalog, allowing for server-side analysis and integration with other geospatial data without needing to download large files.
- **Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)**: Some WorldPop datasets are also shared via HDX.

## 6. Relevance and Applications (especially in Climate-Health)

WorldPop data is invaluable for climate and health applications:

- **Exposure Assessment**:
  - Estimating the number of people exposed to climate hazards (e.g., populations in flood-prone areas, coastal zones vulnerable to sea-level rise, areas experiencing extreme heat).
  - Quantifying populations exposed to poor air quality or vector habitats.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**:
  - Identifying vulnerable populations by combining population data with age/sex structures, poverty maps, and health status information. For example, mapping elderly populations in heatwave-prone areas.
  - Assessing the number of children under 5 or pregnant women in areas at high risk of climate-sensitive diseases.
- **Denominator Data for Health Metrics**:
  - Providing accurate denominators for calculating disease incidence/prevalence rates, vaccination coverage, or access to health services, especially where official census data is outdated or coarse.
- **Disease Burden Estimation**:
  - Estimating the population at risk for diseases like malaria, dengue, etc., by overlaying population maps with maps of environmental suitability for vectors or pathogens.
- **Disaster Response and Management**:
  - Rapidly estimating affected populations during and after extreme weather events.
  - Planning for resource allocation and humanitarian aid.
- **Health Service Planning**:
  - Optimizing the location of health facilities and outreach services based on population distribution and accessibility.
- **Climate Change Adaptation Planning**:
  - Informing strategies to protect vulnerable populations from the health impacts of climate change.

## 7. Conceptual Python Examples for Working with WorldPop Data

WorldPop data is often in GeoTIFF format. Python libraries like `rasterio` and `xarray` (with `rioxarray`) are excellent for handling this type of data.

### Example 1: Opening and Plotting a WorldPop GeoTIFF with `rasterio` and `matplotlib`

```python
import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np # For handling NoData values if necessary

# Assume you have downloaded a WorldPop GeoTIFF file, e.g., population count for a country.
# This is a placeholder path.
worldpop_tiff_path = 'path/to/your/downloaded/worldpop_population_data.tif'

try:
    with rasterio.open(worldpop_tiff_path) as src:
        population_data = src.read(1) # Read the first band
        transform = src.transform
        crs = src.crs
        nodata_val = src.nodatavals[0] # Get the NoData value

        print(f"--- WorldPop Data Loaded ---")
        print(f"Shape: {population_data.shape}")
        print(f"CRS: {crs}")
        print(f"NoData value: {nodata_val}")

        # Handle NoData values for plotting if they exist and are not NaN
        if nodata_val is not None:
            population_data_masked = np.ma.masked_where(population_data == nodata_val, population_data)
        else:
            population_data_masked = population_data # Or handle NaNs if they are used for NoData

        # Plot the data
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))
        show(population_data_masked, ax=ax, transform=transform, cmap='viridis',
             title='WorldPop Population Count (Example)')
        # plt.show() # Uncomment to display plot

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: WorldPop GeoTIFF file not found at '{worldpop_tiff_path}'. Please provide a valid path.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

### Example 2: Using `xarray` with `rioxarray` for WorldPop Data

`rioxarray` extends `xarray` to easily open raster files like GeoTIFFs.

```python
import xarray as xr
import rioxarray # Extends xarray to open rasters
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# This is a placeholder path.
worldpop_tiff_path = 'path/to/your/downloaded/worldpop_population_data.tif'

try:
    # Open the GeoTIFF as an xarray DataArray
    # rds = rioxarray.open_rasterio(worldpop_tiff_path)

    # --- MOCKING a DataArray for demonstration ---
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    mock_lats = np.arange(10.0, 9.0, -0.01) # Example latitudes
    mock_lons = np.arange(38.0, 39.0, 0.01) # Example longitudes
    mock_pop_data = np.random.rand(len(mock_lats), len(mock_lons)) * 100
    mock_pop_data[mock_pop_data < 20] = np.nan # Simulate NoData areas

    rds = xr.DataArray(
        mock_pop_data,
        coords={'y': mock_lats, 'x': mock_lons, 'band': [1]}, # xarray uses y, x for spatial dims
        dims=('y', 'x', 'band'),
        name='population_count'
    )
    rds = rds.squeeze('band', drop=True) # Remove band dimension if it's single band
    rds.rio.set_spatial_dims(x_dim='x', y_dim='y', inplace=True)
    # rds.rio.write_crs("epsg:4326", inplace=True) # Assuming WGS84
    print("--- WorldPop Data Loaded with xarray (Mocked Example) ---")
    # --- END MOCKING ---

    print(rds)

    # Basic statistics
    print(f"\nMax population in a cell: {rds.max().item()}")
    print(f"Mean population (excluding NoData): {rds.mean().item()}")

    # Plotting
    # rds.plot(cmap='magma', robust=True) # robust=True handles outliers in color scaling
    # plt.title("WorldPop Population Count (xarray - Mocked)")
    # plt.xlabel("Longitude")
    # plt.ylabel("Latitude")
    # plt.show() # Uncomment to display

    # Example: Zonal statistics (requires another geospatial dataset for zones, e.g., admin boundaries)
    # import geopandas as gpd
    # admin_boundaries_path = 'path/to/admin_boundaries.shp'
    # admin_gdf = gpd.read_file(admin_boundaries_path)
    # clipped_data = rds.rio.clip(admin_gdf.geometry, admin_gdf.crs, drop=False, invert=False)
    # population_in_zone1 = clipped_data.where(admin_gdf.ADM1_NAME == 'Zone1').sum() # Conceptual

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: WorldPop GeoTIFF file not found at '{worldpop_tiff_path}'. Please provide a valid path.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## 8. Strengths of WorldPop

- **High Spatial Resolution**: Provides population data at a much finer scale than typical census administrative units.
- **Global Coverage with LMIC Focus**: Addresses critical data gaps in many developing countries.
- **Open and Accessible**: Data is freely available, promoting wide use.
- **Methodological Rigor**: Employs advanced statistical and geospatial techniques.
- **Wide Range of Products**: Offers various demographic datasets beyond just population counts.
- **Temporal Consistency**: Efforts are made to produce temporally consistent datasets for trend analysis.

## 9. Limitations and Considerations

- **Model-Based Estimates**: The data are estimates derived from models, not direct counts at the grid cell level. They are subject to uncertainties and errors inherent in the input data and modeling process.
- **Accuracy Varies**: Accuracy can vary depending on the quality and availability of input census/survey data and covariates for a particular region.
- **Static vs. Dynamic Populations**: Most standard WorldPop datasets represent "night-time" or residential population. They may not capture dynamic daily movements or temporary populations (e.g., for work, displacement). However, WorldPop also works on mobility data.
- **Definition of "Settlement"**: The accuracy of constrained population maps depends on the quality of the settlement layers used to define inhabited areas.
- **Temporal Lag**: While updated regularly, there can be a lag between the most recent input data (e.g., census) and the production of the gridded estimates.
