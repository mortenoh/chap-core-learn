# An Introduction to Climate: Systems, Variables, Drivers, and Change

## 1. Defining Climate and Weather

**Weather** refers to the state of the atmosphere at a specific time and place. It includes short-term conditions like temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloudiness, and atmospheric pressure. Weather is what we experience day-to-day.

**Climate**, in contrast, is the long-term statistical average of weather conditions in a particular region, typically calculated over a period of 30 years or more. Climate encompasses average conditions, variability (e.g., seasonal changes, frequency of extremes), and long-term trends. It's often described as "expected weather."

Understanding the distinction is crucial: "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."

## 2. The Earth's Climate System

The Earth's climate is a complex, interactive system consisting of five major components:

### a. Atmosphere

- The envelope of gases surrounding the Earth.
- **Composition**: Primarily nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace gases including greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor.
- **Structure**: Divided into layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, exosphere). Weather phenomena primarily occur in the troposphere.
- **Role**: Drives weather patterns, transports heat and moisture, and plays a critical role in the Earth's energy balance through the greenhouse effect.

### b. Hydrosphere

- All water on, under, and over the surface of the Earth.
- **Components**: Oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, groundwater, glaciers, ice caps, and atmospheric water vapor.
- **Role**: Oceans are a major reservoir and transporter of heat, influencing regional and global climates. The water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation) is a key part of the climate system.

### c. Cryosphere

- The portions of the Earth's surface where water is in solid form.
- **Components**: Sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and permafrost.
- **Role**: High albedo (reflectivity) of ice and snow reflects solar radiation, influencing Earth's energy balance. Melting ice contributes to sea-level rise and can alter ocean circulation.

### d. Lithosphere (Land Surface)

- The Earth's solid outer part, including the crust and upper mantle.
- **Role in Climate**: Land surface characteristics (topography, vegetation, soil type, albedo) influence local and regional climates by affecting energy and water exchange with the atmosphere. Mountains can block air masses and influence precipitation patterns.

### e. Biosphere

- All life on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms.
- **Role**: Vegetation influences albedo, evapotranspiration, and the carbon cycle. Human activities (deforestation, agriculture, fossil fuel burning) are major drivers of current climate change. Plankton in oceans play a role in carbon uptake.

These components are interconnected and interact through various physical, chemical, and biological processes, exchanging energy and matter.

## 3. Key Climate Variables

These are measurable quantities used to describe the state of the climate system.

- **Temperature**: A measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules.
  - Air temperature (surface, upper-air)
  - Sea surface temperature (SST)
  - Land surface temperature
- **Precipitation**: Any form of water that falls from clouds and reaches the ground.
  - Rain, snow, sleet, hail
  - Measured as amount (depth), intensity, frequency, type.
- **Humidity**: The amount of water vapor in the air.
  - Absolute humidity, specific humidity, relative humidity, dew point.
- **Wind**: The movement of air.
  - Speed and direction.
- **Atmospheric Pressure**: The force exerted by the weight of the air above a given point.
- **Solar Radiation**: Energy from the Sun.
  - Incoming solar radiation (insolation)
  - Reflected solar radiation (albedo)
  - Net radiation (balance between incoming and outgoing)
- **Cloud Cover**: The fraction of the sky covered by clouds.
  - Type, height, opacity.
- **Evaporation and Transpiration (Evapotranspiration)**: The process by which water is transferred from the land and water surfaces and from plants to the atmosphere.
- **Sea Level**: The average height of the ocean surface.
- **Ocean Salinity and Acidity**: Important for ocean circulation and marine ecosystems.
- **Snow and Ice Cover**: Extent, thickness, and duration.

## 4. Drivers of Climate

Climate is influenced by a variety of factors operating on different timescales:

### a. Solar Radiation (Insolation)

- The primary source of energy for Earth's climate system.
- Variations in solar output (e.g., sunspot cycles) can have minor effects on climate.
- **Milankovitch Cycles**: Long-term (tens to hundreds of thousands of years) variations in Earth's orbital parameters (eccentricity, axial tilt, precession) that alter the amount and distribution of solar radiation received by Earth, driving ice ages and interglacial periods.

### b. Atmospheric Composition (Greenhouse Gases)

- **Greenhouse Effect**: A natural process where certain gases in the atmosphere (GHGs) trap heat, warming the Earth's surface to a habitable temperature.
- **Key GHGs**:
  - Water Vapor (H2O): Most abundant, acts as a feedback.
  - Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Primary driver of current anthropogenic climate change, released by burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.
  - Methane (CH4): Potent GHG, from agriculture, livestock, natural gas leaks, wetlands.
  - Nitrous Oxide (N2O): From agriculture, industrial processes, fossil fuel combustion.
  - Ozone (O3): In the troposphere, it's a GHG and air pollutant.
  - Fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6): Synthetic, very potent GHGs.
- Changes in GHG concentrations alter the Earth's energy balance.

### c. Earth's Surface Properties (Albedo)

- **Albedo**: The reflectivity of a surface. Light-colored surfaces (ice, snow) have high albedo and reflect more solar radiation. Dark surfaces (oceans, forests) have low albedo and absorb more.
- Changes in land use (deforestation), ice cover, and cloud cover can alter the global albedo, creating feedbacks.

### d. Ocean Currents

- Oceans store and transport vast amounts of heat around the globe.
- Thermohaline circulation (driven by temperature and salinity differences) plays a major role in long-term climate patterns.
- Surface currents influence regional climates.

### e. Plate Tectonics and Volcanic Activity

- **Plate Tectonics**: Over millions of years, the movement of continents affects ocean circulation patterns and mountain building, which influences atmospheric circulation.
- **Volcanic Eruptions**: Large eruptions inject aerosols (e.g., sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere, which can reflect solar radiation and cause short-term global cooling (1-3 years). Volcanoes also release CO2, but anthropogenic emissions are far greater.

### f. Human Activities (Anthropogenic Forcing)

- **Fossil Fuel Combustion**: Releases CO2 and other GHGs.
- **Deforestation and Land Use Change**: Alters albedo, evapotranspiration, and releases CO2.
- **Agriculture**: Releases CH4 (livestock, rice paddies) and N2O (fertilizers).
- **Industrial Processes**: Release GHGs and aerosols.
- **Aerosols**: Tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere (e.g., sulfates from pollution, dust, smoke). Some aerosols reflect sunlight (cooling effect), while others (like black carbon) absorb it (warming effect). They also affect cloud formation.

## 5. Natural Climate Variability

Even without external forcing changes, the climate system exhibits internal variability on various timescales:

- **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**:
  - A recurring pattern of sea surface temperature variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean.
  - **El Niño**: Warmer than average SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific.
  - **La Niña**: Cooler than average SSTs in the same region.
  - **Neutral**: Conditions in between.
  - Affects weather patterns globally (temperature, precipitation, storm tracks) on interannual timescales (2-7 years).
- **Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)**:
  - A longer-term pattern of SST variability in the North Pacific, with phases lasting 20-30 years.
- **North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)**:
  - Fluctuations in atmospheric pressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High.
  - Influences winter weather in Europe and North America.
- **Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)**:
  - SST anomalies in the western and eastern Indian Ocean.
- Other modes of variability exist, contributing to regional and global climate fluctuations.

## 6. Climate Change

**Climate Change** refers to a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions (e.g., more or fewer extreme weather events).

### a. Observed Changes (Evidence for Current Climate Change)

- **Global Temperature Rise**: Unambiguous warming of the climate system. Instrumental records show a global average surface temperature increase of over 1°C since the pre-industrial period (late 19th century), with most warming occurring since the 1970s. Recent years and decades are the warmest on record.
- **Ocean Warming**: Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of the excess heat in the climate system.
- **Sea Level Rise**: Caused by thermal expansion of seawater and melting of land-based ice (glaciers, ice sheets).
- **Shrinking Ice Sheets and Glaciers**: Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass, and glaciers are retreating worldwide.
- **Declining Arctic Sea Ice**: Extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice have decreased significantly.
- **Decreased Snow Cover**: Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has declined.
- **Ocean Acidification**: Increased atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by oceans, leading to a decrease in pH.
- **Changes in Precipitation Patterns**: Some regions are experiencing more intense rainfall and flooding, while others face more frequent and severe droughts.
- **Increased Frequency and Intensity of Extreme Weather Events**: Heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and in some regions, droughts and wildfires.
- **Shifts in Species Ranges and Phenology**: Plants and animals are responding to changing climates.

### b. Causes of Current Climate Change

- The overwhelming scientific consensus, as documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is that human activities are the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.
- **Increased Greenhouse Gas Concentrations**: Emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes have substantially increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years.
- **Radiative Forcing**: These increased GHGs enhance the natural greenhouse effect, leading to a positive radiative forcing (an imbalance in Earth's energy budget, trapping more heat).

### c. Climate Projections (Future Climate)

- Based on climate models and scenarios of future GHG emissions, population growth, socio-economic development, and technological advancements.
- **Continued Warming**: Global surface temperatures are projected to continue rising under all emissions scenarios, but the magnitude depends on future emissions.
- **Further Changes**:
  - More intense and frequent heatwaves.
  - Changes in precipitation patterns (wet areas getting wetter, dry areas drier, generally).
  - Continued sea-level rise.
  - Further decline in Arctic sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets.
  - Increased ocean acidification.
  - More frequent and intense extreme weather events.
- **Impacts**: Significant impacts on ecosystems, human health, water resources, agriculture, infrastructure, and economies.
- **Mitigation and Adaptation**:
  - **Mitigation**: Efforts to reduce GHG emissions (e.g., transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, sustainable land use).
  - **Adaptation**: Actions to adjust to the actual or expected effects of climate change, to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience.

## 7. Climate Modeling

Climate models are sophisticated computer programs that simulate the Earth's climate system.

- **Types**:
  - **General Circulation Models (GCMs)**: Complex models representing the physics, chemistry, and biology of the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. Also known as Earth System Models (ESMs) when they include more components like the carbon cycle.
  - **Regional Climate Models (RCMs)**: Provide higher-resolution climate information for a specific region, often driven by boundary conditions from GCMs.
  - **Simpler Models**: Energy balance models, radiative-convective models.
- **Purpose**:
  - Understand past climate changes.
  - Project future climate scenarios.
  - Test hypotheses about climate system behavior.
  - Assess the impacts of climate change.
  - Evaluate mitigation and adaptation strategies.
- **Process**: Based on fundamental physical laws (conservation of mass, energy, momentum). The globe is divided into a 3D grid, and equations are solved for each grid cell over time steps.
- **Uncertainty**: Arises from incomplete understanding of some climate processes, natural climate variability, and uncertainty in future emissions scenarios. Model ensembles (running multiple models or versions) are used to quantify this uncertainty.

## 8. Importance of Climate Information for Society

Understanding climate and climate change is critical for:

- **Public Health (Relevance to CHAP-Core)**:
  - Predicting and preparing for heatwaves and their health impacts.
  - Understanding the influence of climate on vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue), water-borne diseases, and air quality-related illnesses.
  - Assessing climate impacts on nutrition and food security.
- **Agriculture and Food Security**: Optimizing crop choices, planting times, and irrigation; adapting to changing growing conditions.
- **Water Resource Management**: Planning for changes in water availability, droughts, and floods.
- **Disaster Risk Reduction**: Preparing for and responding to extreme weather events.
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Designing infrastructure (buildings, roads, energy systems) to be resilient to future climate conditions.
- **Energy Sector**: Planning for changes in energy demand (heating/cooling) and supply (e.g., hydropower, renewable energy potential).
- **Ecosystem Management and Biodiversity Conservation**: Protecting species and habitats vulnerable to climate change.
- **Urban Planning**: Designing cities to cope with heat stress, flooding, and other climate impacts.
- **Policy Making**: Informing national and international policies on climate change mitigation and adaptation.

A thorough understanding of climate science is fundamental to addressing one of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the 21st century.
