# Improvement Suggestions:
# 1. **Module Docstring**: Ensure a clear module docstring explains the role of the `assessment` package (e.g., "Contains modules for model evaluation, performance assessment, dataset splitting, and forecast analysis."). (Primary task).
# 2. **Selective Namespace Exports**: If key classes or functions from modules within `assessment` (e.g., `evaluate_model` from `prediction_evaluator.py`, `train_test_split` from `dataset_splitting.py`) are intended as the primary public interface of this package, import them here and list them in `__all__` for cleaner access.
# 3. **Common Assessment Utilities**: If there are common utility functions, constants, or base classes used across different assessment modules (e.g., a base class for evaluation metrics, common plotting utilities for assessment results), this `__init__.py` could be a place to define or expose them.
# 4. **Sub-Package Structure Overview (in Docstring)**: The module docstring could provide a brief overview of the modules contained within the `assessment` package and their respective roles (e.g., "Includes modules for: `dataset_splitting` for creating train/test sets, `prediction_evaluator` for calculating performance metrics, `forecast` for generating evaluation forecasts.").
# 5. **Package-Level Logging Setup**: If the assessment processes generate significant logs or require specific log formatting, consider initializing a package-level logger here (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`, potentially with a `NullHandler` for library use).

"""
This `__init__.py` file marks the `chap_core/assessment` directory as a Python package.

The `assessment` package is designed to house modules and functionalities related to
the evaluation and performance assessment of predictive models within the CHAP-core
framework. This includes tools and methods for:

- Splitting datasets into training and testing sets (e.g., `dataset_splitting.py`).
- Generating forecasts specifically for evaluation purposes (e.g., `forecast.py`).
- Calculating various performance metrics for model predictions (e.g., `prediction_evaluator.py`, `evaluator.py`).
- Organizing and running suites of evaluations (e.g., `evaluator_suites.py`).
- Representing and visualizing assessment results (e.g., `representations.py`).

# Example of how commonly used components could be re-exported:
# from .dataset_splitting import train_test_split_with_weather
# from .prediction_evaluator import evaluate_model, backtest
# from .forecast import forecast_ahead
#
# __all__ = [
#     'train_test_split_with_weather',
#     'evaluate_model',
#     'backtest',
#     'forecast_ahead',
# ]

# By default, an empty __init__.py simply makes the directory a package.
