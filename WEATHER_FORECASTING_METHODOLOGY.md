# Methodology: Using Historical Weather Data for Future Predictions

Predicting weather for "X years" into the future based solely on "the last 10 years" of instrumental data is an extremely challenging task that borders on, and often crosses into, climate projection rather than traditional weather forecasting. Short-term weather (days to weeks) is an initial value problem highly sensitive to current atmospheric conditions. Long-term climate patterns (decades to centuries) are boundary condition problems influenced by factors like greenhouse gas concentrations, solar cycles, etc. Predicting specific weather conditions years ahead with high accuracy is generally not feasible with current science.

However, one can attempt to model and project statistical properties of weather, identify trends, or create scenarios. This document outlines a general methodology for analyzing historical weather data to understand patterns and make _statistically-informed projections or conditional forecasts_, rather than deterministic weather predictions for specific future dates.

## 1. Define Objectives and Scope

- **What to Predict**:
  - Specific variables: Temperature (min, max, avg), precipitation (total, frequency, intensity), wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, etc.
  - Statistical properties: Monthly/annual averages, likelihood of extreme events (heatwaves, droughts), changes in seasonality.
- **Prediction Horizon (X years)**:
  - Short-term (1-2 years): Might capture some persistence from large-scale climate oscillations (e.g., ENSO).
  - Medium-term (5-10 years): Increasingly difficult; trends might be more relevant than specific cycles.
  - Long-term (10+ years): This is firmly in the realm of climate projection, requiring consideration of climate change scenarios (e.g., IPCC SSPs) and likely cannot be reliably done with only 10 years of historical data without incorporating larger climate model outputs.
- **Geographical Area**: Single point, region, or global?
- **Desired Output**: Specific daily values (highly unreliable for long-term), monthly/seasonal averages, probability distributions, trend lines.

**Important Caveat**: Predicting specific daily weather conditions years in advance is beyond current scientific capabilities. The focus here is more on identifying patterns, trends, and potential future statistical distributions.

## 2. Data Acquisition and Preparation

- **Data Source Selection**:
  - Choose reliable sources for historical data (e.g., ERA5, CHIRPS, national meteorological services via APIs like MET.no, Open-Meteo, or direct station data).
  - Ensure the chosen 10-year historical period is representative and of high quality.
- **Variables**: Collect all relevant meteorological variables.
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly, daily, or monthly data. Daily is common for many analyses.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values (interpolation, imputation, or removal if minor).
  - Identify and address outliers (validate if they are true extremes or errors).
  - Ensure data consistency (units, time zones).
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data to the desired temporal resolution for analysis (e.g., daily averages from hourly data, monthly totals from daily data).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

- **Time Series Plotting**: Visualize each variable over the 10-year period to identify:
  - **Trends**: Long-term increase or decrease (e.g., warming trend).
  - **Seasonality**: Regular, repeating patterns within a year.
  - **Cycles**: Longer-term oscillations (e.g., ENSO impacts, if discernible in a 10-year window).
  - **Anomalies/Extremes**: Significant deviations from normal patterns.
- **Statistical Summary**: Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, min, max) for different periods (annual, seasonal, monthly).
- **Decomposition**: Decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components (e.g., using STL decomposition).
- **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation (ACF/PACF)**: Analyze plots to understand the temporal dependencies and lags in the data, which helps in model selection (especially for ARIMA-type models).
- **Cross-Correlations**: Examine relationships between different weather variables.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - **Lagged Variables**: Past values of the target variable (e.g., temperature yesterday, temperature same day last week/month/year).
  - **Time-based Features**: Day of year, month, season, year, indicators for holidays (if relevant for human-influenced variables like air pollution).
  - **Rolling Statistics**: Moving averages, moving standard deviations to capture evolving local trends or volatility.
  - **Interaction Terms**: e.g., temperature \* humidity.
  - **External Regressors (if applicable and predictable)**:
    - Climate indices (e.g., ENSO index, NAO index) if their future values can be reasonably estimated or scenario-based.
    - For very long-term projections (beyond the scope of just 10 years of data), CO2 concentrations or other climate forcing data would be essential.

## 4. Model Selection

The choice of model depends heavily on the prediction horizon, the nature of the data, and the specific objectives.

### a. Statistical Time Series Models

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Good for data with clear trends and seasonality (SARIMA).
  - **Strengths**: Well-understood, captures temporal dependencies.
  - **Limitations**: Assumes stationarity (after differencing), linear relationships. May not be robust for very long-term, non-stationary climate trends if only based on 10 years of data.
- **Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters)**: Good for data with trends and seasonality.
  - **Strengths**: Simpler than ARIMA, often performs well.
  - **Limitations**: Similar to ARIMA regarding long-term non-stationarity.
- **Prophet (by Facebook)**: Designed for time series with strong seasonality and trend, robust to missing data and outliers.
  - **Strengths**: Handles multiple seasonalities, easy to use.
  - **Limitations**: Can be a "black box"; long-term trend extrapolation needs careful handling.
- **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**: For multivariate time series, modeling relationships between multiple variables.

### b. Machine Learning Models

- **Regression Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines like XGBoost/LightGBM)**:
  - **Strengths**: Can capture non-linear relationships, handle many features.
  - **Limitations**: Require careful feature engineering (especially for time dependence); prone to overfitting if the 10-year period is not representative of future dynamics. Extrapolation beyond the training data range is risky.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, GRUs**:
  - **Strengths**: Designed for sequential data, can learn complex temporal patterns.
  - **Limitations**: Data-hungry (10 years might be insufficient for very complex models), computationally intensive, prone to overfitting.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining strengths of statistical and ML models.

### c. Climate Model Downscaling (for longer-term "X years")

- If "X years" implies climate timescales (e.g., 10-30 years), relying solely on 10 years of historical weather data is insufficient.
- A more appropriate approach would involve:
  1. Using outputs from Global Climate Models (GCMs) under various emission scenarios (e.g., from CMIP6).
  2. Statistically or dynamically downscaling these coarse GCM outputs to the region of interest.
  3. The 10 years of historical data could be used for bias correction or calibration of the downscaled GCM outputs.

## 5. Model Training, Validation, and Selection

- **Data Splitting**:
  - **Chronological Split**: Train on the first N years (e.g., 7-8 years), validate on the remaining years (e.g., 2-3 years).
  - **Cross-Validation**: Time series cross-validation techniques (e.g., rolling forecast origin) are crucial. Standard k-fold cross-validation is not appropriate as it breaks temporal order.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **For continuous variables**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared.
  - **For probabilistic forecasts**: Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS).
  - **Skill Scores**: Compare against a baseline model (e.g., climatology, persistence).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization based on validation set performance.
- **Model Selection**: Choose the model that performs best on the validation set according to the chosen metrics and is robust. Consider model complexity and interpretability.

## 6. Prediction/Forecasting and Uncertainty Quantification

- **Generate Forecasts**: Use the selected and trained model to predict weather variables for the future "X years".
- **Iterative Forecasting**: For multi-step ahead forecasts, decide whether to use a recursive approach (predict one step, use prediction as input for next) or a direct approach (train separate models for different horizons).
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: This is CRITICAL.
  - **Statistical models**: Often provide confidence intervals (e.g., ARIMA).
  - **Ensemble methods (for ML)**: Train multiple models or use techniques like bootstrapping to generate a distribution of forecasts.
  - **Probabilistic forecasts**: Output a probability distribution for each variable at each time step.
  - Clearly communicate that uncertainty grows rapidly with the forecast horizon.

## 7. Limitations, Challenges, and Ethical Considerations

- **Limited Historical Data**: 10 years is a very short period in climatological terms. It may not capture long-term climate variability, rare extreme events, or be representative of future conditions, especially under climate change.
- **Climate Change**: Weather patterns are non-stationary due to climate change. Models trained solely on past data without accounting for future climate forcings will likely be inaccurate for long-term predictions. The 10-year trend might be misleading if it's part of a larger, more complex climate signal.
- **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions (Chaos Theory)**: Weather is a chaotic system. Small errors in initial conditions (or model parameters) amplify over time, making specific long-range forecasts highly unreliable. This is why ensemble forecasting is standard in operational weather prediction.
- **Model Misspecification**: All models are simplifications of reality.
- **Extrapolation Risks**: Predicting far beyond the range of training data is inherently risky.
- **Communication of Uncertainty**: It's crucial to communicate the high degree of uncertainty associated with such long-range "predictions." Avoid presenting them as deterministic forecasts.
- **Misinterpretation**: Users might misinterpret statistical projections as precise weather forecasts.

## Conclusion

While using 10 years of historical weather data can help identify recent trends and seasonal patterns, predicting specific weather conditions for "X years" into the future with high accuracy is generally not feasible. The methodology should focus on:

- **Short-term statistical forecasting (e.g., next season to 1-2 years)**: Leveraging seasonality and recent trends.
- **Longer-term projections (multiple years)**: Understanding potential shifts in statistical distributions, trends, and likelihoods, ideally by integrating data from climate models and scenarios rather than relying solely on a short historical instrumental record.

For any projection extending beyond a few years, it is highly recommended to consult and incorporate outputs from comprehensive climate models (like those contributing to CMIP6) and consider various climate change scenarios.
