# Improvement Suggestions:
# 1. Module Docstring: Add a module docstring explaining the intended purpose and current status (incomplete).
# 2. Resolve Commented-Out Code: Decide whether to complete, remove, or refactor the commented model loading logic.
# 3. Clarify `model_names` and `models` Variables: Document the purpose of these module-level variables.
# 4. Define or Import Dependencies: If activating commented code, ensure `models_path` and `get_model_from_yaml_file` are available.
# 5. Provide Usage Context: Explain how this module is intended to be used within the CHAP-Core system.

Module intended for registering or loading R model configurations.

This script appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete implementation for
dynamically loading R model specifications from configuration files.
It defines a list of model names and an empty dictionary intended to store
loaded model instances or configurations.

The core logic for iterating through `model_names`, finding their
configuration files, and loading them is currently commented out.
Variables like `models_path` and the function `get_model_from_yaml_file`
are used in the commented section but are not defined in this file,
implying they would need to be imported or defined elsewhere if this
functionality were to be activated.
