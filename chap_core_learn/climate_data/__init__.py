# Improvement Suggestions:
# 1. **Module Docstring**: Add a comprehensive module docstring that clearly defines the scope and purpose of the `climate_data` package (e.g., "This package contains modules for accessing, processing, and representing climate data from various sources like GEE, seasonal forecasts, etc."). (Primary task).
# 2. **Review and Action Commented Code**: The existing commented-out imports (Protocol, ClimateData, Shape, TimePeriod) and `__all__` list should be reviewed. If they represent a desired public API for this package, they should be uncommented, and imports verified. If obsolete, they should be removed to prevent confusion.
# 3. **Clarify `Shape` Datatype**: The commented import of `Shape` from `chap_core.datatypes` suggests its relevance. If this is a key type for defining geographical areas for climate data, its role and usage within this package should be clear, and its re-export considered if it's part of the package's intended API.
# 4. **Expose Key Components**: If modules within this package (like `seasonal_forecasts.py`) provide classes or functions that are central to the package's purpose, consider importing and re-exporting them here (using `__all__`) for easier access by other parts of the `chap-core` system.
# 5. **Define Package-Specific Base Classes or Utilities**: If there are common patterns, base classes, or utility functions specific to handling different types of climate data sources that would be shared across modules in this package, this `__init__.py` could be a place to define or expose them.

Initialization file for the `chap_core.climate_data` package.

This package is intended to house modules related to the acquisition,
processing, and representation of climate data used within the CHAP-core framework.
This may include interfaces to climate data sources (e.g., Google Earth Engine,
seasonal forecast providers), data transformation utilities specific to climate
variables, and potentially specialized data types for climate information.

The content below is currently commented out and seems to be an older attempt
to define a public API for this package by re-exporting common types. This
should be reviewed and updated or removed.
"""

# from typing import Protocol
#
# from chap_core.datatypes import ClimateData, Shape # Shape might be a custom geometry type
# from chap_core.time_period import TimePeriod
#
# # __all__ defines the public API of this package when `from chap_core.climate_data import *` is used.
# # It also helps tools like linters and IDEs understand what's meant to be public.
# __all__ = [
#     "ClimateData",  # Assuming re-export from chap_core.datatypes
#     "Shape",        # Assuming re-export from chap_core.datatypes
#     "TimePeriod",   # Assuming re-export from chap_core.time_period
#     "Protocol"      # Re-exporting Protocol from typing might be for convenience
# ]
#
# # Note: If these types are central to this package's usage, uncommenting and ensuring
# # correct imports would be the way to make them available as, e.g.:
# # from chap_core.climate_data import ClimateData
