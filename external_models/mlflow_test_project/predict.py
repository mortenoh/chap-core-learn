# Improvement Suggestions:
# 1. Unreachable Code: Remove or move the `sys.exit()` call that currently prevents the file I/O operations from executing.
# 2. Robust Argument Parsing: Use `argparse` for handling command-line arguments, which provides better error messages, help, and type checking.
# 3. Error Handling: Implement try-except blocks for file operations and argument validation to handle potential errors gracefully.
# 4. Logging: Replace `print()` statements with the `logging` module for better traceability and control over script output.
# 5. Model Utilization: The script accepts `model_file` but doesn't use it. A prediction script should load and apply the model to `future_data`. (The current file copy operation is likely a placeholder).

"""
Prediction script for an MLflow project.

This script takes future data, a trained model file, and an output file path
as command-line arguments. It currently copies the content of future_data to
the output file. In a typical scenario, it would load the model and use it to
make predictions on the future_data, then save those predictions.
